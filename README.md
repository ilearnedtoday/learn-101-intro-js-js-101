# JavaScript Basics Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to teach the basics of JavaScript, including:
- Data types and variables
- Operators
- Boolean logic
- Arrays
- Conditional statements

You will be given code with intentional bugs that you need to fix. This exercise is structured to help you understand fundamental JavaScript concepts by correcting the provided code.

## Instructions

1. The `exercise.js` file contains code with bugs. Your task is to correct the code.
2. **Do not modify the function signatures** provided. Only correct the parts of the code that contain bugs.
3. Once you've completed the exercise, **push your changes** back to your GitHub repository.
4. Once you've pushed to the main branch, tests will run if they all pass then you've successfully submitted.

## Exercises

### 1. String Operations
In the `concatenateStrings()` function:
- The current implementation incorrectly concatenates strings. Fix the code to properly concatenate two strings, convert the result to uppercase, and calculate the length of the concatenated string.

### 2. Boolean Logic
In the `checkConditions()` function:
- The code contains logical errors in the Boolean operations. Fix the code to return the correct results for AND, OR, and NOT operations.

### 3. Array Operations
In the `arrayOperations()` function:
- Fix the code to correctly retrieve the first and last elements of an array and calculate the length of the array.

### 4. Conditional Statements
In the `conditionalCheck()` function:
- Correct the conditional statements to handle positive, negative, and zero values correctly.

## Tests

To help you verify your corrections, tests have been provided in the `test.js` file. You can run these tests to check if your changes are correct, but you shouldn't worry much about them since they will run automatically.
